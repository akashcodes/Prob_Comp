\section{Problem1}
Deduce the expected run time of Quick-Sort, using conditional expectation.\\



\section{Problem2}
Why does the probability that the second door hides a car changes after Monty Hall opens the third door? An intuitive interpretation is preferred.\\

\section{Problem3}
The proof of Jensen's Inequality in the text book assumes that the convex function $f$ is twice differentiable. Present a convex function that is not differentiable, and show that Jensen's Inequality holds even if the convex function is not differentiable. Only discrete probability is considered.\\

\section{Problem4}
Do Bernoulli experiment for 20 trials, using a new 1-Yuan coin. Send the result to \url{advanced\_algorithm@163.com} in a string $s_1s_2 \cdots s_i \cdots s_{20}$, where $s_i$ is 1 if the $i^{th}$ trial gets Head, and otherwise is 0.\\
